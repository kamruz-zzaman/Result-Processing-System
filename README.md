```
### Installation

Follow [this](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) or [this](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) documentation to setup python virtual environment, if you want to run the project and install packages in an isolated environment for your convenience or you can skip this step.

#### Run the following commands to install all the required packages, apply database migrations and create super-user for the database

```bash
#### Install dependencies using `pip`, `pip3` or `pipenv`:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Apply migrations:
python3 manage.py migrate
